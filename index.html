    <h3>
        Dear Riham,
       I am writing this to apologize to you. I am truly sorry for the altercation we had earlier.
       I know that wasn't you. I was rude to you, I insinuated a chance of me leaving. I wont leave you Riham,
        I never will. I apologize for treating you rather harshly earlier. I dont hate you, I love you, all the time, 
        in all your shapes and forms. I love you and I dont blame you for anything. I truly dont blame you for anything. I am here 
        and I'll keep my word to you, I will contain you and love you just the way you are - and I think you're perfect :D 
        That altercation shall not put distance between us, and I hope we can be on the same page, and that I am able to put the slightest smile 
        on my favourite face at the very least <333</font color>
    </h3>
